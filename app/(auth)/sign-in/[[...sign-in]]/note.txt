this is optional route. clerk need this inorder to use cusstom route. 

Optional Catch-all Segments
Catch-all Segments can be made optional by including the parameter in double square brackets: [[...folderName]].

For example, app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js will also match /shop, in addition to /shop/clothes, /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts.

The difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (/shop in the example above).

Route	Example URL	params
app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js	/shop	{ slug: undefined }
app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js	/shop/a	{ slug: ['a'] }
app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js	/shop/a/b	{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }
app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js	/shop/a/b/c	{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }
